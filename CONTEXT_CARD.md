# Context Summary

This project, *Project-Insanity*, began as a simple command-line toy but aspires to become a cross-platform experience with a hypnotic GUI. The README opens with a summary and bullet list of the "Roadmap of Madness," omitting step 15 by design. The `run()` function in `src/main.py` now supports a `--gui` flag to launch a Tkinter interface and an `--oracle` flag for text prophecies.

## Key Features
- **Roadmap of Madness** in `README.md` outlines the chaotic vision.
- The final section "Manifestation & Reach" details plans to infect the world with a viral GUI.
- Setup instructions cover virtual environment creation, dependency installation, running the script, and running tests.
- Tests under `tests/` verify the default output, oracle mode, and GUI flag handling.
- `requirements.txt` lists example dependencies, including `pyinstaller` for packaging.
- `.gitignore` excludes Python caches and virtual environment directories.
