# Context Summary

This project, *Project-Insanity*, began as a simple command-line toy but aspires to become a cross-platform experience with a hypnotic GUI. The README opens with a summary and a bullet list outlining the "Roadmap of Madness." The `run()` function in `src/main.py` prints a birth message or a random prophecy when run with the `--oracle` flag.

## Key Features
- **Roadmap of Madness** in `README.md` outlines the chaotic vision.
- Setup instructions cover virtual environment creation, dependency installation, running the script, and running tests.
- Tests under `tests/` verify the default output and the oracle mode.
- `requirements.txt` lists example dependencies for potential future features.
- `.gitignore` excludes Python caches and virtual environment directories.
