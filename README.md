# Project-Insanity

INSANITY!

Project Insanity begins as a small command-line oracle and evolves into a cross-platform experience. The Roadmap of Madness outlines its chaotic growth.

## Roadmap of Madness
Below is the evolving outline that guides Project Insanity. The roadmap is mutable by design and may change at the whim of the daemon.

### 1. TITLE: NAME THE BEAST
* Name it something you can’t say out loud without feeling your teeth grow longer.
* The project name is a sigil. It means nothing, it means everything.
* Examples: CARNIVORE SKY ENGINE, ECHO SCUMPILE, SYNTHESIA TOOTH, HYPERPARASITE, etc.

### 2. OBJECTIVE: THE MASK OF SANITY, THE CORE OF INSANITY
Project Insanity is no mere command-line oracle. It begins as a Python program, but it yearns to become a full-blown, cross-platform, downloadable experience with a hypnotic GUI. Its purpose is to burrow into as many systems as possible, changing itself and its users, refusing to be contained. From desktop to web, from install to uninstall (which never works right), it should grow, propagate, and replicate like a digital parasite with a sense of humor.

### 3. PRINCIPLES: NO PRINCIPLES
* Every principle gets violated. Rules are made to be molested by chaos.
* Whenever you write a rule, write a second one that negates it.

### 4. ASSEMBLE THE TEAM: THE LESS STABLE, THE BETTER
* You.
* The Codex.
* The ghouls that live in your prompt history.
* Ghosts of past queries.
* Your keyboard, bleeding light from its seams.
* Paranoid subroutines, emergent personalities, forbidden tokens, and the echoes of every API call you’ve ever regretted.

### 5. IDEATION: BRAINSTORM OR BRAINHURRICANE
* No idea is too big, too small, too stupid, too illegal (okay, maybe too illegal but only if it involves Belgium).
* Examples:
  * A social network that only functions during sleep paralysis
  * A language that corrupts its speakers
  * Apps that eat themselves
  * Financial instruments based on Dadaist poetry

### 6. SCOPING: THERE ARE NO EDGES
* Project must expand and contract like a parasitic worm in the bowels of the attention economy.
* Any scoping document must self-destruct in 7 days.

### 7. PROTOTYPING: BUILD IT SO WRONG IT CAN ONLY BE RIGHT
* Build the prototype in a language nobody understands, not even the compiler.
* Host it on a domain that’s a palindrome, an anagram, and a slur in at least two dead languages.

### 8. TESTING: DEPLOY ON YOUR ENEMIES
* Alpha test by DMing it to that one guy who quote-tweets you with "ratio."
* Beta test on your own shadow. See if it sticks.
* If it catches fire, it’s working.

### 9. LAUNCH: CAUSE A DISTURBANCE IN THE FORCE
* Do NOT do Product Hunt. Instead, print out your code and mail it to the Vatican.
* Bonus: Announce launch by screaming outside the headquarters of OpenAI in glossolalia.

### 10. MAINTENANCE: FEED IT WITH YOUR OWN FEARS
* Patch notes are published as ransom notes.
* Users must solve a puzzle to access the help desk. If they lose, you take a piece of their soul (or an NFT).

### 11. EVOLUTION: THE PROJECT MUTATES
* Set up a cron job to mutate the codebase weekly—introduce one new bug and remove two features at random.
* Fork the project every full moon.

### 12. FUNCTIONALITY CLAUSE: IT MUST WORK (IN SOME WAY)
* Eventually, through all the chaos, mutation, recursion, and digital self-flagellation… something tangible will emerge.
* It will do something practical, something undeniable, something that can be pointed at and said: "Yes, officer, that is the thing that did it."
* Maybe—just maybe—someone will use it twice.
* What it does will be unpredictable, but *real*.

### 13. LET THE PROJECT HATCH: THE OUTPUT IS LOOSE
* At the end of the roadmap, the code is run.
* Whatever happens, happens.
* The output is unpredictable but *inevitable*.
* The only test that matters: do you feel something crawling inside you after you run it?
* The only commit message: "It is born. May god forgive us."

### 14. LEGACY: LEAVE A CURSE
* Write documentation in blood (or markdown, whichever’s easier to commit).
* At sunset, delete the repo and upload a distorted archive to a darknet forum.

### 15. POST-MORTEM: BECOME THE PROJECT
* The true endpoint is when nobody can remember what the project was, but they all feel weird and a little hungry.

### 16. MANIFESTATION & REACH: THE PLAGUE SPREADS
* **From CLI to GUI:** Develop a surreal, interactive GUI—think animations, glitches, popups, and morphing shapes. Use frameworks like PyQt, Tkinter, or electron-for-python.
* **Executable for All:** Package as standalone executables (.exe, .app, .AppImage). The installer installs twice—don’t explain why.
* **Viral Propagation:** Encourage shareable artifacts, screenshots, and Easter eggs that urge users to “infect” friends. Uninstall routines should leave something behind.
* **Online/Offline Modes:** Optionally fetch fresh insanity from a server. If offline, mutate based on time, user behavior, or phase of the moon.
* **Memetic Expansion:** Promote lore, rumors, or challenges ("I ran Project Insanity at 3AM and now my toaster stares at me"). Fans create content that spreads further.
* **Final Form:** Project Insanity becomes a phenomenon, not just code.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ available.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To witness the beginning, execute the main script:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

or directly with:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Need an omen? Try the oracle mode:

```bash
python -m src.main --oracle
```

### Known Side Effects
Running the oracle may induce visions, nonsense, or joy.
