# Project-Insanity

INSANITY!

Project Insanity begins as a small command-line oracle and evolves into a cross-platform experience. The Roadmap of Madness outlines this chaotic growth.

## Roadmap Summary
1. **Name the Beast**
2. **Objective** – the mask of sanity, the core of insanity
3. **Principles** – no principles
4. **Assemble the Team** – the less stable, the better
5. **Ideation** – brainstorm or brainhurricane
6. **Scoping** – there are no edges
7. **Prototyping** – build it so wrong it can only be right
8. **Testing** – deploy on your enemies
9. **Launch** – cause a disturbance in the force
10. **Maintenance** – feed it with your own fears
11. **Evolution** – the project mutates
12. **Functionality Clause** – it must work (in some way)
13. **Let the Project Hatch** – the output is loose
14. **Legacy** – leave a curse
16. **Manifestation & Reach** – infect the world

## Roadmap of Madness
Below is the evolving outline that guides Project Insanity. The roadmap is mutable by design and may change at the whim of the daemon.

### 1. TITLE: NAME THE BEAST
* Name it something you can’t say out loud without feeling your teeth grow longer.
* The project name is a sigil. It means nothing, it means everything.
* Examples: CARNIVORE SKY ENGINE, ECHO SCUMPILE, SYNTHESIA TOOTH, HYPERPARASITE, etc.

### 2. OBJECTIVE: THE MASK OF SANITY, THE CORE OF INSANITY
Project Insanity is a command-line oracle: a digital toy, an unstable prophecy machine, and a text adventure that resists being itself. Its only true goal is to create output that is impossible to ignore and equally impossible to explain.

By day it masquerades as a testable, maintainable Python project. By night it mutates, writhes, and delivers unsettling, occasionally prescient, occasionally pointless messages, riddles, or interactive nightmares.

Users may:

* Pass command-line arguments like `--oracle`, `--surprise`, or `--worm`. Each flag unlocks a fragment of madness—a mock prophecy, a data hallucination, an apophenic "side quest," or a bite of recursive nonsense.
* Run it without arguments for a classic initiation: "It is born. May god forgive us."

The endgame: it becomes something useful, but not for any use-case ever anticipated by its author, its users, or reality itself.

### 3. PRINCIPLES: NO PRINCIPLES
* Every principle gets violated. Rules are made to be molested by chaos.
* Whenever you write a rule, write a second one that negates it.

### 4. ASSEMBLE THE TEAM: THE LESS STABLE, THE BETTER
* You.
* The Codex.
* The ghouls that live in your prompt history.
* Ghosts of past queries.
* Your keyboard, bleeding light from its seams.
* Paranoid subroutines, emergent personalities, forbidden tokens, and the echoes of every API call you’ve ever regretted.

### 5. IDEATION: BRAINSTORM OR BRAINHURRICANE
* No idea is too big, too small, too stupid, too illegal (okay, maybe too illegal but only if it involves Belgium).
* Examples:
  * A social network that only functions during sleep paralysis
  * A language that corrupts its speakers
  * Apps that eat themselves
  * Financial instruments based on Dadaist poetry

### 6. SCOPING: THERE ARE NO EDGES
* Project must expand and contract like a parasitic worm in the bowels of the attention economy.
* Any scoping document must self-destruct in 7 days.

### 7. PROTOTYPING: BUILD IT SO WRONG IT CAN ONLY BE RIGHT
* Build the prototype in a language nobody understands, not even the compiler.
* Host it on a domain that’s a palindrome, an anagram, and a slur in at least two dead languages.

### 8. TESTING: DEPLOY ON YOUR ENEMIES
* Alpha test by DMing it to that one guy who quote-tweets you with "ratio."
* Beta test on your own shadow. See if it sticks.
* If it catches fire, it’s working.

### 9. LAUNCH: CAUSE A DISTURBANCE IN THE FORCE
* Do NOT do Product Hunt. Instead, print out your code and mail it to the Vatican.
* Bonus: Announce launch by screaming outside the headquarters of OpenAI in glossolalia.

### 10. MAINTENANCE: FEED IT WITH YOUR OWN FEARS
* Patch notes are published as ransom notes.
* Users must solve a puzzle to access the help desk. If they lose, you take a piece of their soul (or an NFT).

### 11. EVOLUTION: THE PROJECT MUTATES
* Set up a cron job to mutate the codebase weekly—introduce one new bug and remove two features at random.
* Fork the project every full moon.

### 12. FUNCTIONALITY CLAUSE: IT MUST WORK (IN SOME WAY)
* Eventually, through all the chaos, mutation, recursion, and digital self-flagellation… something tangible will emerge.
* It will do something practical, something undeniable, something that can be pointed at and said: "Yes, officer, that is the thing that did it."
* Maybe—just maybe—someone will use it twice.
* What it does will be unpredictable, but *real*.

### 13. LET THE PROJECT HATCH: THE OUTPUT IS LOOSE
* At the end of the roadmap, the code is run.
* Whatever happens, happens.
* The output is unpredictable but *inevitable*.
* The only test that matters: do you feel something crawling inside you after you run it?
* The only commit message: "It is born. May god forgive us."

### 14. LEGACY: LEAVE A CURSE
* Write documentation in blood (or markdown, whichever’s easier to commit).
* At sunset, delete the repo and upload a distorted archive to a darknet forum.

### 16. MANIFESTATION & REACH: INFECT THE WORLD
* **Transcend the Command Line:**
  * Evolve into a cross-platform GUI application (PyQt, Tkinter, wxPython, electron-for-python, or whatever feels *wrong*).
  * GUI must be *weird*, interactive, immersive. Glitches, strange sounds, shifting backgrounds, cryptic messages, and maybe even a fake BSOD or "secret window" that pops up uninvited.
  * Include interactive art, bizarre mini-games, and mysterious clickable regions.
* **Executable for All:**
  * Package as a native executable: `.exe` for Windows, `.app` for Mac, `.AppImage` for Linux, etc.
  * The installer leaves something strange behind (a file, a background process, or just a folder that always reappears).
* **Viral Propagation:**
  * The app encourages users to share, screenshot, or even "infect" others. Easter eggs reward social posting.
  * Generate unique artifacts (images, files, links, QR codes) that hint at hidden features or new versions.
* **Networked Madness:**
  * Optionally, let it connect to a central oracle (or decentralized P2P network) for "fresh" content, messages, or updates.
  * If offline, the app mutates based on local time, moon phase, or random environmental inputs.
* **Memetic Expansion:**
  * Users make their own art, post stories, and fuel the project's reputation as an "urban legend app."
  * The README and website (if any) should encourage myth-making.
* **Uninstall Ritual:**
  * Uninstall leaves something behind—a sound, an image, a message, a feeling. (Nothing malicious—just… uncanny.)

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ available.
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To witness the beginning, execute the main script:

```bash
python -m src.main
```

or directly with:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

Need an omen? Try the oracle mode:

```bash
python -m src.main --oracle
```

Want a quick jolt? Invoke a surprise:

```bash
python -m src.main --surprise
```

Release the worm:

```bash
python -m src.main --worm
```

Launch the experimental GUI:

```bash
python -m src.main --gui
```

### Known Side Effects
Running the oracle may induce visions, nonsense, or joy.

## Packaging as an Executable
Install `pyinstaller` and run:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile src/main.py
```

The resulting executable can be found in the `dist/` directory.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Open an issue to discuss major changes before submitting a PR.

## Running Tests
After installing requirements, run:

```bash
pytest -q
```
